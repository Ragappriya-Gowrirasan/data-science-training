We're all writing at the time of our pain, but there is very limited information on the time frames for recovery.  For me, I started at 80mg of Atorvastatin right after a stent placement.  It wasn't until 5 months later that I experienced horrible joint pain that kept moving throughout my body.  It was to the point that it kept me up all night.

One month later after stopping taking the drug, I'm still dealing with horrible shoulder pain, but it seems to be getting better; but very slowly.  My wrist has experienced excruciating pain and is finally getting better; I can make a fist.  My shoulders, I couldn't even lift my arms without feeling excruciating pain.  Now, I'm still in pain, but I can lift arms slightly higher.  My legs have been nonstop, but the pain oddly moves around.  Now, it is in the back of my upper hamstrings where the glutes meet; resulting in pain and discomfort when I sit and stand, and it forces me to walk with a limp.

I'm trying to be optimistic based on a few reviews that people did recover within 3 months.  To date, mine is at the one month mark.  So, I'm hoping to find a site that gives more information on the recovery times which is quite important for people to know.Read More Read Less   1 ShapeCreated with Sketch.thumb_up copy 5Created with Sketch.Report this postFill 3Created with Sketch.",N/A
